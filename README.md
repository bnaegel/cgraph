# Component-graphs

Component-graphs are an extension of the concept of component-trees developed in the image processing domain [1]
Component-trees enable to filter an image by means of the connected components of its *cuts* or *thresholdings*. Component-trees are defined on images having their values in a totally ordered space. Component-graphs extend the component-tree concept and are defined on images having their values in a space which is not totally ordered (i.e. partially ordered). 

This repository contains two folders, each corresponding to a stand-alone application bases on component-graphs.
